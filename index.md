We're a friendly and inclusive running club based in South East London. We meet at the Old Nun's Head every Tuesday for a sociable ~45 minute run. There's typically around 30 to 40 runners, and we run in all weather unless there are weather warnings.

You can leave a bag or coat in the pub (at your own risk so careful with valuables!).

### Our runs

We always have at least three groups:

* 4 miles at 10 minute miles (~6km at 6:10 kms)
* 5 miles at 9 minute miles (~8km at 5:40 kms)
* 6 miles at 8 minute miles (~10km at 5:00 kms)

On the last tuesday of the month it's **5k night** for all our groups!

We'll never leave you behind on a run, we'll always wait at traffic lights and tops of hills to allow people to catch their breath, and always have a dedicated run leader and normally a dedicated tail runner too.

We run different routes each time, so make sure to come back to see all that the local area has to offer!

### After the runs

We stick around at The Old Nun's Head for a drink and a burger - we encourage anyone to stay but won't mind if you want to head home straight after!

# Other things

### Charity

Where we can, we fundraise for [Westminster House Youth Club](https://www.whyc.co.uk/). We've raised several thousand pounds for them over the years with pub quizzes, bake sales, parkrun pacing, and more

### Kit

Want some snazzy kit? We've got tshirts, vests, hi-vis long sleeves, and hoodies! [Fill in our form to order kit](https://bit.ly/runheadtshirts). We send off kit orders every two months, and will contact you via email with payment details. Once the kit's arrived (normally two to three weeks after we put in the order) it'll be ready to collect next time you're down at Runhead.
