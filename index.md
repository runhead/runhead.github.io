Welcome to Runhead AC!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92479727/137222394-ed927d61-3417-44f0-8426-cb6a002adcb1.png)

We're a friendly and inclusive running club based in South East London. We meet at the Old Nun's Head every Tuesday for a sociable ~45 minute run. There's typically around 30 to 40 runners, and we run in all weather unless there are weather warnings.

Our facebook group is a great source of getting tips and hints from your fellow runners, plus contains the latest info on our runs and more!

You can leave a bag or coat in the pub (at your own risk so careful with valuables!).

### Our runs

We always have at least three groups:

* 4 miles at 10 minute miles (~6km at 6:10 kms)
* 5 miles at 9 minute miles (~8km at 5:40 kms)
* 6 miles at 8 minute miles (~10km at 5:00 kms)

On the last tuesday of the month it's **5k night** for all our groups!

We'll never leave you behind on a run, we'll always wait at traffic lights and tops of hills to allow people to catch their breath, and always have a dedicated run leader and normally a dedicated tail runner too.

We run different routes each time, so make sure to come back to see all that the local area has to offer!

### After the runs

We stick around at The Old Nun's Head for a drink and a burger - we encourage anyone to stay but won't mind if you want to head home straight after!

# Other things

### Charity

Where we can, we fundraise for [Westminster House Youth Club](https://www.whyc.co.uk/). We've raised several thousand pounds for them over the years with pub quizzes, bake sales, parkrun pacing, and more

### Kit

Want some snazzy kit? We've got tshirts, vests, hi-vis long sleeves, and hoodies! [Fill in our form to order kit](https://bit.ly/runheadkit). We send off kit orders every two months, and will contact you via email with payment details. Once the kit's arrived (normally two to three weeks after we put in the order) it'll be ready to collect next time you're down at Runhead.

### Staying in touch

[Fill in our contact details form](https://bit.ly/runheadmembership). This is super important as we collect your emergency contact details just in case the worst happens! We'll also sign you up to our infrequent mailing list containing information on Runhead trips, info on other runs, charity fundraisers, and more!

### Paid membership

> **Note: You will never be required to pay to come to Runhead on a Tuesday or on a trip or other run with us**

We're an affiliated club with England Athletics, and if you want to represent Runhead AC, we'd love to have you as an affiliated member! We charge £19, most of which goes to England Athletics, with a small amount helping support Runhead. In exchange, you get

* £2 discount on entry to many races
* 10% discount at some running shops like Run & Become, Running Works
* Entry to England Athletics competitions
* Access to some England Athletics run leadership coaching courses
* Support your local friendly running club!

If this sounds like your cup of tea, [fill in our contact details form again](https://bit.ly/runheadmembership) and at the last question, make sure you check the box to become a full member. At some point we'll add your data to England Athletics and you'll get an email with a request for payment, and that's it! You'll be a fully affiliated member. England Athletics affiliation runs april to april, but always costs the same amount so for most impact sign up in Spring.
